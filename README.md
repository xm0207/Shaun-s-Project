## About This
Here I want to share some of codes and ideas I use, as well as problems I encountered so that everyone saw it may gain some inspiration.
I would change some of notation parts in case someone use them without making any change in their coursework. 
## Python
The python codes I use are mainly about classification, data cleaning & regression, and some basic machine learning applications
### R
R is more useful in my statistic assignments, so I use them more often in courseworks.
